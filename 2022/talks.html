			<h3 id="Bergold">Topological Drawings meet Classic Theorems from Convex Geometry</h3>
			<h4>Helena Bergold (FU Berlin)</h4>
			
			<p align="justify"> In this talk we discuss classic theorems from Convex Geometry in the context of topological drawings and beyond. In a simple topological drawing of the complete graph \(K_n\), any two edges share at most one point: either a common vertex or a point where they cross. Triangles of simple topological drawings can be viewed as convex sets. This gives a link to convex geometry. Among the classic theorems from convex geometry, we discuss Kirchberger's theorem, Carathéodory's theorem and Helly's theorem. </p>

			<h3 id="Fairley">Incidence theorems concerning circular nets</h3>
			<h4>Alexander Fairley (TU Berlin)</h4>
			
			<p align="justify"> The talk will begin with an introduction to circular nets.
			In discrete differential geometry, circular nets provide a discretisation of surfaces that are parametrised along curvature lines. I will present a sequence of incidence theorems that are essential to construct a class of circular nets that provide a discretisation of surfaces with linear, circular, planar or spherical curvature lines. The foregoing surfaces have remarkable geometric properties. For instance, surfaces with circular curvature lines are quartic surfaces that are classically known as Dupin cyclides. </p>

			<h3 id="Gardiner">Viability of Nonlinear Statistical Shape Models for Medical Applications</h3>
			<h4>Ben Gardiner (TU Berlin)</h4>
			
			<p align="justify"> In the modern medical field, algorithmic or AI-based approaches can be taken to guide reconstructive surgery or potentially even 3d printing of organs, but generating medically viable shapes is still computationally difficult. One particular tool used in collecting and generating shapes is the Statistical Shape Model (SSM), which is a compact geometric model that describes a collection of similar multidimensional object, by containing a mean and shape variation. Uses of the SSM could be to classify a scan into healthy or pathological or to generate a best-fitting shape to match an existing body.  </p>
			
			<p align="justify"> The traditional SSM takes a linear approach to this and is computationally quite efficient, but in the medical field, there are numerous examples where linear interpolation yields a medically non viable output. In this talk, I will give an overview of SSMs and examine some non-linear approaches that attempt to solve the problem of medical viability.  </p>

			<h3 id="Koser">Asymptotic self-similarity for a model of
	shape-memory alloys</h3>
			<h4>Melanie Koser (HU Berlin)</h4>
			
			<p align="justify"> If a previously deformed wire made out of special Nickel-Titanium is heated, the wire returns to its original form. This phenomenon is called the shape-memory effect. The cooling (or heating) of a material leads to a first order solid-to-solid phase transformation. During the cooling the lattice structure of a material changes abruptly at a critical temperature. The high temperature phase is called austenite and the low temperature phase is called martensite. Cooling of the austenite leads to the abrupt formation of martensitic nuclei.  Heating reverts the martensitic transformation, i.e. the lattice structure changes at a high temperature back to the lattice structure of the austenite. </p>

			<p align="justify"> We are interested in the martensitic phase transformation with two martensitic variants. In particular, we aim at a better understanding of the appearing microstructure, i.e. the geometry at the very small scale-structure, emerging during a martensitic phase transformation. Therfore, we study a mathematical model postulated by Kohn and Müller (1992 & 1994), which leads us to a nonconvex singularly perturbed variational problem. We prove asymptotic self-similarity of minimizers. Our results generalize the result by Conti (2000) to various physically relevant  boundary conditions, more general domains, and arbitrary volume fractions. </p>
			
			<p align="justify"> This is joint work with Sergio Conti, Johannes Diermeier, and Barbara Zwicknagl. </p>

			<h3 id="Polzin">Direct low-rank approximation of transfer operators and coherent sets</h3>
			<h4>Robert Malte Polzin (FU Berlin)</h4>
			
			<p align="justify"> The topic of the present paper has been motivated by a recent computational framework that provides highly scalable identification of reduced Bayesian and Markov relation models and the inclusion of a priori physical information. An efficient approach to date for the identification of finite-time coherent sets in time-dependent dynamical systems on the other hand are transfer operators. Numerical techniques for this purpose rely on the estimation and further numerical processing of a transition matrix. In this article, we reinterpret a directly low-rank transfer operator as a product of the Ulam matrix and a stochastic projection which depends on affiliations to the so-called latent states. Our method can be seen as an extension of Bayesian model reduction directly from trajectory data, and it allows us to identify a low rank projected transfer operator together with the associated transition probabilities. We illustrate the potential of the method on several examples. </p>
